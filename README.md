# Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks

Code for ICML 2024 [Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08627)

## Model Architecture

We integrate a noval symmetrization module to handle E(3)-invariance on top of a GNN message passing module.
